# Why do we do Retrospectives?

* To reflect on how things are going; it’s part of continuous improvement
* To take time to bring up problems and deal with them
* To provide an opportunity to identify areas to improve, keep the action items visible (e.g. on a poster on the wall)
* Provides a place to talk about issues, make sure everyone on the project feels like they have input into the project’s processes
* Provides a place to have long discussions that arise during the course of day-to-day work, focus on big-picture
* Helps build trust, helps identify conflicts, or elephants in the room
* Provide a place in which quieter people can bring up their issues
* Provides a place for otherwise-difficult conversations
* People feel more comfortable bringing up their issues, it’s a different, more relaxed atmosphere from the usual work environment;
* Provides a place for more vocal people to really hear what others are thinking, explicit focus on listening
* Provides a place for everyone to “get on the same page,” i.e. get alignment on the reality of the state of the project
* Build consensus on how the project is going at a high level

## What are the most important goals of a Retrospective?

1. To improve process
1. To identify common purpose throughout the team and develop the team’s culture
1. To communicate everyone’s status and thoughts

## How to do continuous improvement

1. When it’s someone’s turn to speak, no one else is allowed to chime in
1. After everyone has spoken, there’s group discussion about action items
1. Action items hould be assigned to an individual, even if they’re a team-wide goal, so that someone is responsible for following up
1. Action items are limited so that there aren’t so many that it’s hard to know where to start
