# Seeking Inspiration for Personal Objectives

It’s our responsibility as individuals to propel our companies forward; into the future, overcoming barriers,
delivering value and innovation, and course-correcting all the way until we reach a destination that fulfils the desired company vision. As a Technical Manager with a past in software development, my first thought goes straight to software engineering; specifically engineering maturity.

Personal development objectives have to be your own, you can seek advice from your day-to-day colleagues,
development manager, line manager, heads of departments, human resources team, company directors, etc.
Read internet blog posts that match your particular area of the business, your skills-set and potentially even your potential career path; it can help you unlock potential and maximise impact within the workplace.
Living authentically is a perpetual challenge that yields great rewards. It’s a noble path that you won’t regret following.

## Setting Good Personal Objectives

In my experience as a manager, there is, occasionally a rather large elephant in the room when it comes time for us all to think about setting Personal Development objectives.
The personal angle is essentially forgotten and an individual’s objectives end up being one more documented form of what the team expects of them over the coming review period.
When this happens, it is often far more valuable for the individual and their manager to iterate over the initial task-like objectives and reformulate them as something more concretely representing personal growth.
However, this can be a slow process and it often suffers from delays because (for example) it’s difficult to be truly introspective, or because ‘keeping the lights on’ usually takes priority over personal development activities.
For a manager it can also involve considerable repetition, depending on the number of direct reports.
While these things are very real barriers to success, I urge you not to let them become blockers. Here are a few pointers that have helped me address this problem in the past…

## How to make it Personal?

Ask yourself the following question to help identify whether an objective is personal or not:
"If my team’s priorities changed tomorrow and we suddenly weren't able to <for example, re-architect the platform>, could I still achieve this objective in the available time?"
If you can answer yes to this question, then you have a personal objective and you’re off to a great start!

## How to define an Outcome?

Another way to think of personal objectives is by considering outcomes, i.e. how you will personally change (positively) by having delivered the anticipated team priorities?
I would question the level of introspection at this point if an answer comes back as ‘I won’t have changed’ by delivering the team’s work, because every task should represent an opportunity to develop or improve yourself.
If day-to-day tasks are really that laborious then you should perhaps be thinking about manufacturing additional opportunities to improve.

The hard things often deliver the most significant impact. A little effort spent on something that’s outside your comfort zone
can have a significantly greater ROI than any training course, webinar, conference or task; and in my experience, lessons learned
while working outside a comfort zone tend to stick with you far longer throughout your career.

## How to continuously learn

We need to be able to learn, grow and adapt to changing landscapes. We need to put the work in, step-by-step, continually developing ourselves as individuals so that we contribute positively to the company’s forward motion.
Imagine your employer as a horse and cart for a moment. The company (and its products) are represented by the cart, and the workforce by the horse; the cart doesn’t push the horse to its destination.
It is entirely the horse’s responsibility to pull the cart forward to their desired destination.
Every day, week or month we choose not to develop ourselves is a day, week or month that the horse grows comparatively weaker; allowing opportunities for other rigs to pass us by.

It’s easy to lose yourself in the vastness of ‘company’ challenges though, so zoom out on this picture and think of your individual team as the horse and cart instead.
Your team’s mission and objectives are delivered by the individuals within, the forward motion we each apply to solving hard problems
and overcoming barriers on a day to day basis. The more you personally stand still, the less distance your team (and ultimately the company) will be able to travel.

## Why you need to be selfish about personal development activities

In my experience there are very few things that absolutely cannot absorb a small delay, especially when it would allow someone to squeeze the opportunity for a little personal improvement as well.
A small amount of (constructive) selfishness at the right time can be a force multiplier for your personal development; but equally, a lost opportunity might never be found again.

It is entirely in your hands to decide how much you invest during Personal Development reviews; an individual could spend time thinking introspectively about where they are now, where they want to be next year (or even beyond),
and what personal or professional traits they could develop between now and the next review period to ultimately achieve career advancement;
or they could choose to do a great deal less because (for example) the perception is that team priorities don’t allow them time for either introspection or action.

## Authentic People

_Authentic people are deeply in tune with who they are and what they want._
Their ability to live their life in harmony with their true selves comes from some clearly discernible habits.
They help others to be their authentic selves. Authentic people don’t expect others to play a role either.
They don’t make people feel as though they have to fit into a certain mold or to project a certain image to be a part of their lives.
Their commitment to being authentic gives other people the freedom to live authentically too.

_They let go of negative people._
Authentic people have too much self-respect to put up with people who treat them badly or have ill will toward them, and they have too much respect for other people to try to change them.
So they let go—not out of anger, but out of their need to be true to themselves.

_They express their true feelings and opinions, even when they’re not popular._
Authentic people don’t live a go-along-to-get-along lifestyle.
They’re simply not capable of acting in a way that’s contrary to what their principles dictate, even if there are repercussions.
They prefer not to lie to other people, and they especially can’t lie to themselves.
This means that they’re willing to live with the repercussions of staying true to themselves.

_They are confident._
We’re afraid that somebody is going to discover that we’re not as smart, experienced, or well-connected as we pretend to be. Authentic people don’t have that fear.
Their confidence comes from the fact that they have nothing to hide. Who they appear to be is who they really are.

_They prefer deep conversations._ 
You won’t find authentic people gossiping about others or giving their opinions on the latest celebrity scandals.
They know all of that stuff is nothing more than cultural trappings, and they choose to talk about things that matter.
Eleanor Roosevelt nailed this one. She once said, “Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people.”

_They don’t complain about their problems._
Complaining is what you do when you think that the situation you’re in is someone else’s fault or that it’s someone else’s job to fix it.
Authentic people, on the other hand, are accountable. They understand that they—and no one else—are responsible for their own lives, so there’s no point in complaining.

_They make the best out of any situation._
Authentic people have a very firm grasp on reality. When things don’t go their way, they don’t get trapped in denial, and they don’t sit around whining about how things should be different.
They simply take stock of the way things are and, if there’s nothing they can do to change the situation, they figure out a way to make the best of it.

_They don’t get stressed when someone doesn’t like them._
It’s never fun accepting that someone doesn’t like you, but a lot of times that discomfort comes from trying to figure out what you did wrong or how you can fix it.
Authentic people don’t have that anxiety because they would never try to change themselves to influence someone else’s opinion.
They accept that other people have a right to be authentic about their own feelings, even if those feelings are negative toward them.
